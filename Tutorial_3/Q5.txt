The code is for a threaded counter, the expected output should be = number of threads * increment_val
In this case the number of threads are 2 and the increment_val is 100000.
So the expected value is 200000.
But in practical as they are parallelized using the threads, as soon as the thread is free it prints and goes back to original 
func so we might not get the expected value every time.
The practical value is less than or equal to the expected value.
